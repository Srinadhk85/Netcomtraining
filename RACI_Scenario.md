#RACI Scenario
Imagine that you are a junior engineer. 
In your work, you take on more responsibility than you can handle. 
This situation might mean that you have too many tasks to work on or that you took on tasks that are outside your role. 
As a result, you might experience a very large workload.
It can be useful to discuss the responsibilities on your team with your colleagues and your manager by using a RACI matrix. 





##Steps to follow
To address the situation using the RACI model, you'll want to clearly define and communicate roles and responsibilities within
your team to avoid the problem of taking on too much responsibility. 
Here's how you can approach this:

1. Understand the RACI Model
* [x] Responsible - Who is doing the work?
* [x] Accountable - Who is ultimately answerable and completion of the task?
* [x] Consulted - Who are the subject matter experts who need to provide input or guidance? (Two-way communication)
* [x] Informed - Who needs to be kept in the loop on progress or decisions? (One-way communication)

2. Identify the list of tasks
- Create a list of all tasks and responsibilities you currently have. Include those that are within your role and those that seem to be outside of it.

3. Map Out the RACI Matrix
- Assign Roles: For each task, determine who is Responsible, Accountable. Be honest about your capacity and consider if you're overextending yourself.
- Discuss with Your Manager: Present the RACI matrix to your manager. Explain the challenges you're facing due to the current distribution of tasks.

4. Propose Adjustments
- Reallocate Tasks: Suggest redistributing tasks that are outside your scope to the appropriate roles. You might need to delegate some tasks to others who are better suited or have the bandwidth.

- Clarify Responsibilities: Ensure that your role is clearly defined and that responsibilities are aligned with your capabilities and job description.

5. Implement Changes
- Once agreed upon, implement the new RACI matrix. Ensure everyone on the team is aware of their responsibilities.

6. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review the RACI matrix to ensure itâ€™s still effective. Adjust as necessary if new tasks arise or if team dynamics change.
