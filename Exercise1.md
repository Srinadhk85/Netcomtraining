**#Activity: Exercise 1**

**Identify an incident**
The first step of incident response is to determine when the incident occurred.

Team members make this determination by completing a short checklist, which might be a series of yes or no questions. If certain answers, or a minimum number of answers, are yes, the team declares an incident, which initiates the incident recovery plan.

Based on the scenario for this lab, answer the following questions:
* Has an event occurred that will affect the company?
* Will the event disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the company's assets?
* Which type of incident might have occurred (for example, DoS, data loss, equipment, or physical)?
* Is the level of impact low, medium, or high?
* Do you believe that this company is experiencing an incident?
* For the DoS attack described, what groups or managers would be appropriate to contact?

1. Has an event occurred that will affect the company?
Yes. A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a significant event that is directly affecting the company's operations.

2. Will the event disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the company's assets?
Yes, a DoS attack specifically targets availability, meaning legitimate users may not be able to access services, causing a disruption in operations.

3. Which type of incident might have occurred?
DoS attack is the identified incident type.

4. Is the level of impact low, medium, or high?
The impact is high due to the significant disruption of the company's operations and customer access.

5. Do you believe that this company is experiencing an incident?
Yes, based on the scenario and evidence of disruption, this is an incident that requires an incident response plan.


6. For the DoS attack described, what groups or managers would be appropriate to contact?
The following groups or individuals would be appropriate to contact during a DoS attack:
* IT Operations: To analyze and mitigate the technical aspects of the attack.
* Security Operations (SOC): To investigate the source and nature of the attack and implement countermeasures.
* Network Administrators: To monitor network traffic and potentially block incoming malicious traffic.
Incident Response Team: To coordinate and handle the overall response to the incident.
* Legal/Compliance Teams: To assess potential regulatory impact or liabilities related to service disruption.
* Executive Management/Business Continuity Teams: To make strategic decisions regarding communication, downtime, and restoration efforts.
* Public Relations/Communications Team: If necessary, to manage communication with customers and stakeholders.
