Activity
–Use a search engine to learn more about each category in a RACI chart
»Describe the difference between R and A.
»Describe the difference between C and I.
–Can one person’s name appear in more than one category? Why or why not?
•Evaluation–You will work in groups to present your results.


*To complete the activity based on the RACI categories, here's what we need to do:*

1. Research the RACI Categories
Use a search engine to gather detailed information about each category in the RACI chart. This will help you understand the differences between the categories and how they are applied in practice.

2. Describe the Differences
Difference Between "R" (Responsible) and "A" (Accountable):
Responsible (R): This person is tasked with doing the actual work. They are responsible for completing the task or activity. There can be multiple people responsible for a task.
Accountable (A): This is the person who is ultimately answerable for the task. They have the final authority and make sure that the task is completed satisfactorily. Only one person should be accountable for each task to avoid confusion.
Difference Between "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed):
Consulted (C): These individuals are consulted before a decision is made or an action is taken. Their input is valuable, and they provide feedback. This is a two-way communication.
Informed (I): These people are kept informed about progress and outcomes. They do not contribute to the decision-making process but need to be aware of the developments. This is one-way communication.

3. Can One Person’s Name Appear in More Than One Category?
Yes, one person’s name can appear in more than one category.
Why: In some cases, a person may have multiple roles in a task. For example, a Project Manager could be Accountable (A) for a project’s success, Responsible (R) for certain key tasks, and also need to be Informed (I) about other aspects of the project. However, it’s important to ensure that roles are clearly defined to avoid conflicts and confusion.

4. Evaluation and Group Presentation
Work in Groups: Collaborate with your peers to compile and compare your research findings.
Prepare Your Presentation: Organize your results in a clear and concise manner. You can create a slide deck, a poster, or any other format suitable for presenting your findings to the class or group.
Present: Share your insights with the group, explaining the key differences between the RACI categories and how they impact task management.
