**#Creating a Budget: An Overview**
**What is a Budget?**
A budget is an estimate of your expenses (money you spend) compared to your income (money you earn) over a specific period, such as a month.

Budgets help you control your finances by showing how much money is available for essential items, savings, and other expenses.

A well-maintained budget ensures you have enough for your necessities and helps you manage unexpected financial challenges.

**#Steps to Create a Budget#**
**Identify Income:**
* Calculate all sources of income (salary, freelance work, investments) for the time period you are budgeting for.

**List Essential Expenses:**
* Prioritize your needs, starting with fixed expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and debt payments.
* Essential expenses are items that are non-negotiable and need to be covered first.

**List Non-Essential Expenses:**
* Identify flexible expenses such as entertainment, dining out, hobbies, or luxury items. These can be adjusted or cut if needed.

**Track Actual Spending:**
* Regularly record how much you are actually spending in each category to ensure it aligns with your budget.
Tracking allows you to spot areas where you may overspend or save more than expected.

* A budget is a powerful tool to manage your money, plan for the future, and avoid financial stress.
