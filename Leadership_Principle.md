* Invent and Simplify and Think Big: Innovation often requires simplifying processes or products, and both principles are rooted in challenging the status quo to create better outcomes.

2. Which leadership principles do you think are opposites?
* Frugality vs. Think Big: Thinking big often requires significant investments, whereas frugality encourages minimal spending. Balancing ambition with resource constraints can be challenging.

* Bias for Action vs. Dive Deep: A bias for action promotes quick decision-making, while diving deep encourages thorough analysis, which can sometimes slow down decisions.

* Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit vs. Earn Trust: While challenging ideas shows conviction, it can sometimes create tension that needs to be managed carefully to maintain trust among teams.

3. Which leadership principles do you consider your strengths?

* Bias for Action: I tend to make quick decisions and adapt to changes, which has allowed me to move projects forward efficiently.

* Learn and Be Curious: I am always looking to learn new things and ask questions, which helps me grow both personally and professionally.

4. Which leadership principles can you develop?
* Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: Sometimes I find it difficult to voice disagreements, especially with senior leaders. I can work on being more assertive while still committing to team decisions once they are made.

* Think Big: I tend to focus on short-term results and need to work on considering the bigger picture and long-term impact.

* Frugality: I could improve my ability to find cost-effective solutions and be more mindful of resource usage.
